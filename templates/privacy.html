    <p>This is the privacy policy for ClassFinder. It outlines how we collect, use, and protect your personal information.</p>
    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

    <p>Class information cannot be deleted, only the link between you and the class.</p>
    <p>While class information may not be able to be deleted with your account, all class data is removed at the end of a semester.</p>
    <p>While your account is active, your connection to a class may be public, this is intended for people with the same class to find others with that class. You should assume that all class data is public.</p>
    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>Data is only used for website functions, like showing current class.</p>
    <h2>Information Sharing</h2>
    <p>No data is shared with third parties, except in the case of law enforcement.</p>
    <h2>Security Measures</h2>

    <h2>Cookies</h2>
    <p>Cookies are not able to be disabled as they are for basic website function.</p>
